[12/3/24, 21:24:47] ChloeH: Hi Tamara, this is Chloe! Hope you had a great Thanksgiving and your week’s been going well so far.
Sorry for the delay in connecting it’s a crazy workday. I’ve been thinking about the movie night and it was so much fun. I really enjoyed getting to talk to you and love to see you again! I was wondering do you have availability this week? Also I’m curious what do you usually enjoy doing for fun?
If you’re up for hanging out, let me know! :)
（hope you don’t feel like reading a email lol）
[12/3/24, 22:38:09] Tamara: Hi Chloe, great to hear from you - had a lovely thanksgiving and hope you too!  And no problem at all, it’s one of the busiest times of the year!
Sure, I’d like that! Next week would be better for me tho (I’m a bit sick and have family over the weekend). I’m fairly free except Tuesday evening. Let me know if you have time!
And I’m up for pretty everything! I like museums, going for strolls, eating, drinking, etc.
And I feel you - writing messages can sometimes feel like writing a mail or letter ;)
[12/4/24, 11:21:33] ChloeH: Hey Tamara I’m sorry to hear that. :( Are you feeling better？hope you get plenty of rest and get well soon! We can meet next week.
[12/4/24, 11:22:12] ChloeH: Does next Friday afternoon work for you？We can go to MET if you haven’t been there before. I will be off from work after 1pm and meet you at your office if you’re free. Apart from this I prob would need to do some research and get back to you as I haven’t been out for a while lol
[12/4/24, 11:23:11] ChloeH: If you like French food I know a great French restaurant Amelie Bistro. We could have dinner there or let me know if you have anything in mind.
[12/4/24, 11:23:48] ChloeH: Hope you have a great weekend with your family and take care！
[12/4/24, 22:23:00] Tamara: Thank you so much! It’s not getting better, but I’m sure a few days of recovery will do the trick. Hope you’re safe from the flu!
[12/4/24, 22:23:31] Tamara: Sounds lovely! I haven’t been to the MET in quite some time, so I’m happy to go
[12/4/24, 22:24:17] ChloeH: Thank you！hope you have a speed recovery
[12/4/24, 22:24:26] Tamara: I may have a meeting around 12am-1pm, but perhaps we could meet around 2-3pm?
[12/4/24, 22:24:41] ChloeH: Sure that totally works
[12/4/24, 22:25:03] ChloeH: Actually I just found that MET close at 9PM on Friday…thought they close at 5PM
[12/4/24, 22:25:23] Tamara: And yes we can go for french food or anything really! I’m vegetarian, that’s my only dietary restriction
[12/4/24, 22:25:33] Tamara: This is great! So no rush!
[12/4/24, 22:25:40] ChloeH: Thanks for letting me know!
[12/4/24, 22:25:49] Tamara: Of course!!
[12/4/24, 22:26:15] ChloeH: I just came back from work and note there’s Rockefeller tree lighting ceremony.It came to mind that if you’re interested i can bring you access the employee channel where have a better view of the trees and the rooftop of 30Rock.
[12/4/24, 22:26:23] ChloeH: image omitted
[12/4/24, 22:27:08] ChloeH: We are not allowed to access there today but except today every other time we are free to bring guess
[12/4/24, 22:27:17] Tamara: It’s beautiful! I did not know there was such a tree!
[12/4/24, 22:27:22] Tamara: I’d love that!
[12/4/24, 22:28:54] ChloeH: Although I didn’t got the chance to see it today but I can share with you tmr.  i pass by the Christmas tree at Bryant park and literally made a wish there you can feel better soon！
[12/4/24, 22:29:00] ChloeH: image omitted
[12/4/24, 22:30:12] Tamara: The tree looks wonderful! Thanks for sharing! And that’s very sweet of you!!
[12/4/24, 22:31:00] Tamara: By the way, I’m soon gonna crash (my eyes are closing themselves), but thank you for thinking of the MET & co and your wishes! I wish you also a great weekend ☺️
[12/4/24, 22:31:37] ChloeH: You too！have a great night and sleeping helps with recovery
[12/5/24, 17:59:37] Tamara: Thanks! I’m way better!
[12/5/24, 17:59:57] Tamara: This tree is really at Bryant Park?
[12/5/24, 18:00:08] Tamara: I must have missed it somehow
[12/5/24, 23:37:26] ChloeH: Really happy for you！Sorry if I interrupt your sleep……Just got home.
[12/5/24, 23:37:59] ChloeH: Yes it’s near to Bryant Park Winter Village
[12/5/24, 23:38:12] ChloeH: image omitted
[12/5/24, 23:38:41] ChloeH: Didn’t forget to take a photo of the Rockefeller Christmas Tree
[12/6/24, 16:59:55] ChloeH: Hey Tamara，Hope you’ve already fully recovered! ：）
[12/6/24, 17:00:08] ChloeH: Since your family is visiting NYC，It would be a great idea to take them from Bryant Park along 6th Avenue （Ave of the Americas) to 49th Street near Rockefeller. The area is beautifully decorated for Christmas and looks amazing.
[12/6/24, 23:10:11] Tamara: Hi Chloe! No worries - my phone is muted past a certain time :)
[12/6/24, 23:10:54] Tamara: I’ll definitely have to go there! It looks like one of these cheesy Netflix Xmas romantic comedies. You see what I mean?
[12/6/24, 23:11:25] Tamara: This is a great idea and recommendation! Thanks a lot! We will definitely do that! 😍
[12/6/24, 23:11:52] Tamara: I’m reaching the end of the tunnel! Hope all is well and wishing you a pleasant weekend :)
[12/9/24, 19:14:52] Tamara: Hi Chloe, how was your weekend? Would you also be open to going to tge MoMa on Friday?
[12/9/24, 20:41:02] ChloeH: Hi Tamara！it’s great. How was yours？
[12/9/24, 20:41:12] ChloeH: Yeah sure I’m open to going to the Moma
[12/9/24, 20:41:45] ChloeH: How was the tour with your family？
[12/9/24, 20:42:37] ChloeH: My team had to work over the weekend but this week we are finally able to wrap things up and be chill lol
[12/9/24, 20:43:22] ChloeH: Haven’t got the chance to visit MoMa before and would love to explore
[12/10/24, 07:55:02] Tamara: Good morning, I’m sorry to read you had to spend your weekend in the office! Hope things get slower as of now…
[12/10/24, 07:55:26] Tamara: I had a great weekend! We did some sightseeing, cultural stuff and ate a lot! So happy me
[12/10/24, 07:55:52] Tamara: That’s great! It just reopened, so it’s perhaps worthwhile:)
[12/10/24, 23:31:52] ChloeH: that’s wonderful ！Happy for you :)
[12/10/24, 23:33:48] ChloeH: Sounds exciting. When did they reopened？I didn’t even know they close lol
[12/10/24, 23:34:23] ChloeH: I saw the clock is on display now. Looking forward to it！
[12/11/24, 18:05:28] Tamara: In late October, if I recall correctly. It was for minor renovations, I think
[12/11/24, 18:05:34] Tamara: Which clock??
[12/12/24, 11:03:32] ChloeH: Hi Tamara！good morning
[12/12/24, 11:03:41] ChloeH: It not a actual clock. It’s a looped video super cut made by Christian Marclay showing montage of scenes from film and television that feature clocks and timepieces.
[12/12/24, 11:03:55] ChloeH: That’s nice
[12/12/24, 11:04:48] ChloeH: How’s your week so far
[12/12/24, 14:49:08] Tamara: Ow, my bad! So sorry! Yes, I am also looking forward to it! The last time I went there (MoMA) was some 14 years ago. I’m sure much has changed since that!
[12/12/24, 14:49:53] Tamara: It’s been going well! The sudden drop in temperatures today has been rough, but it has been great otherwise!. How about you?
[12/12/24, 14:50:06] Tamara: Speaking of the MoMA, when should we meet tomorrow?
[12/12/24, 14:51:04] Tamara: I’ll be working from home tomorrow (meeting is on Zoom). We could perhaps meet around 3pm in front of the museum?
[12/12/24, 18:12:38] ChloeH: No no my bad. I didn’t clarify. Lol it’s confusing sometime
[12/12/24, 18:14:14] ChloeH: Yeah that sounds great. See you then！！I will be off from work after 1pm and can be there at 3.
[12/12/24, 18:45:13] ChloeH: Happy to hear you’ve had a great week! Make sure to wear a warm coat and stay cozy
[12/13/24, 09:09:32] Tamara: No problem! Happens to the best of us even!
[12/13/24, 09:09:54] Tamara: Thank you! It’s getting so cold again!
[12/13/24, 09:10:03] Tamara: I’ll see you later then!
[12/13/24, 09:43:23] Tamara: Should I take tickets?
[12/13/24, 13:24:31] ChloeH: See you later！
Finally got away from work
[12/13/24, 13:24:33] ChloeH: No no
[12/13/24, 13:25:03] ChloeH: I have a MoMa membership so I will get the tickets for us
[12/13/24, 13:28:49] Tamara: Amazing!
[12/13/24, 13:28:56] Tamara: See you!
[12/13/24, 14:53:41] ChloeH: I just arrive :)
[12/13/24, 14:56:22] Tamara: Me too! I’m inside
[12/13/24, 14:57:56] ChloeH: Just got in
[12/13/24, 14:58:18] Tamara: I’m upstairs
[12/13/24, 14:58:57] ChloeH: Which entrance？
[12/13/24, 14:59:48] Tamara: On the 53rd
[12/13/24, 15:00:29] Tamara: I’m near the stairs leading to the gift shop
[12/13/24, 21:15:56] Tamara: Hii Chloe, did you get home safely? Just did! 
I wanted to thank you for the day out, the diner (let me foot the bill next time ;)), the card and the chocolate - it was delicious! I had a great, great time and look forward to next time! ☺️
In the meanwhile, I also wish you all the best for the new year and hope you have a restful time in the mountains! Tous mes vœux de fin d’année !!
[12/13/24, 21:36:42] ChloeH: Hi Tamara，I just left Path train station and walking toward home. Will let you know when I arrive home！
[12/13/24, 21:52:47] ChloeH: Just got home！
You’re very welcome！Really appreciate you spending time with me on this cold day. Thank you for teaching me French and German and telling more about Switzerland！glad you like the chocolate.
[12/13/24, 21:53:58] ChloeH: Me too，was having the best Friday night in 2024. Looking forward to seeing you again！
[12/13/24, 21:54:38] ChloeH: Hope you have a great Christmas with your family and do something fun！
[12/13/24, 23:07:22] Tamara: Wonderful! Hope you’re all bundled in your cover after this cold evening!
[12/13/24, 23:07:50] Tamara: Of course! Thanks to you for the great company! And my pleasure!
[12/13/24, 23:08:13] Tamara: Wishing you a great end of the year! Good night!
[12/13/24, 23:08:54] ChloeH: You too！:) have a great night and Christmas and new year.
[12/13/24, 23:11:30] ChloeH: Btw thank you for recommending the Scum Manifesto！I just purchased it from Amazon and hopefully it will arrive soon. Would you mind let me know the name of other books you were mentioning to me？
[12/14/24, 09:33:33] Tamara: Here’s the link to the PDF version of the manifesto: https://editions-ismael.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1968-Valerie-Solanas-S.C.U.M.-Manifesto.pdf
[12/14/24, 09:33:41] Tamara: Here’s the other book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herland_(novel)?wprov=sfti1
[12/14/24, 09:33:48] Tamara: And of course!
[12/14/24, 20:11:33] ChloeH: OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH Tamara! Can’t wait to dive into them :)
By the way, the Geminid Meteor Shower peak is tonight! Not sure if you’ll be able to see it from the city, but it’s worth checking out. It’s expected to be start around 9PM and ended at 2AM
[12/15/24, 23:14:07] Tamara: Let me know what you think of them! I really did enjoy herland!
[12/15/24, 23:15:12] Tamara: And thank you for the suggestions! I did not see anything unfortunately… did you? I read that something similar will happen on Tuesday night
[12/18/24, 21:40:45] ChloeH: Me neither. My friend and I were standing there for hours on Saturday shivering like idiots in the freezing cold and saw nothing. We must be looking at wrong direction.
[12/18/24, 21:51:27] ChloeH: Sure I will！I skimmed through those books quickly over the weekend and yesterday I was hidden in my office’s restroom to search the authors’s stories lol. Those are fascinating. Felt like if I understand their background information I can understand their book better. I’m planning to take some time this weekend to read it properly. I really want to dive deeper into their perspective and see how it connects with social psychology or whether their arguments can be scientifically supported.
[12/18/24, 21:54:37] ChloeH: How was your weekend with your friend？did you guys have nice dinner？
[12/18/24, 22:00:15] ChloeH: Really wanted to sit down and take some time to read the books but this week has been busy as hell. Didn’t even sleep last night and I was working nonstop until now. Truly feeling like a ‘slave’ at the moment.
[12/18/24, 22:00:28] ChloeH: As you’re flying back to Switzerland tomorrow for Christmas，hope you’ll have a wonderful time with your family and that your essay writing goes smoothly. Safe travels!😊
[12/24/24, 03:31:50] Tamara: I’m so sorry! Knowing what NYC cold weather feels like now, I can only how brutal that time in the cold must have felt… It’s also perhaps the city lights that make it impossible to see past through them…
[12/24/24, 03:33:19] Tamara: I’m glad you enjoyed reading about them! I never do that, but perhaps should… Did you have the occasion to do some reading this weekend? (Btw sorry for my late reply - these past few days were quite hectic…)
[12/24/24, 03:33:48] Tamara: It was a very nice night out and I enjoyed seeing my friend. We ended up in the same flight back to Switzerland
[12/24/24, 03:34:50] Tamara: I’m very sorry about that. I cannot say that I know how it feels, but I can imagine how demanding this must be. Are you now at the end of the peak period? Also, do you have a few days off?
[12/24/24, 03:35:39] Tamara: Thank you very much! It’s great to be back - it has been snowing quite a lot, so the views are wonderful! Hope you also have a great time & take care !
[12/24/24, 18:04:38] ChloeH: Thank you！Merry Christmas ：）
[12/24/24, 22:01:51] ChloeH: This is actually my first time reading books by Valerie Solanas and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, so I was really curious to learn more about their backgrounds and what they stood for. Sometimes the context surrounding a book—like the author’s perspective and personal life, the historical era, the audience’s reaction, or even how it’s translated into another language—can be just as fascinating as the book itself. It usually makes my reading experience more multidimensional and helps me understand the work better.
I caught a terrible cold last Saturday so I didn’t make much progress over the weekend beyond coughing and sleeping :( . But I was really happy to receive the paperbacks of Herland and Scum Manifesto! :) I had to replace Scum Manifesto because the cover was damaged, so I’ve started reading Herland first.
Before the paperback arrived, I was reading the Chinese translation of it. In Mandarin, we have different forms of ‘they’ depending on gender—‘他们’ for males and ‘她们’ for females. What really bothered me was that the translator used the male form ‘他们’ even when referring to an entirely female group. It’s such an ironic choice in a book like this, as it reinforces the idea of women being treated as the secondary gender.
[12/25/24, 01:18:01] ChloeH: Thanks for saying that—it’s okay though! We were able to found some photos online, and they were beautiful. We’ve decided that next time, we’ll head out of the city to get a better view. It’s definitely the light pollution was blocking the view.
[12/25/24, 01:37:50] ChloeH: Please don’t worry about it! I completely understand. I hope you’re having a great time with your family and enjoying the holidays. I do want to apologize for my late replies sometimes—clients have been driving me a bit crazy lately. If I weren’t sitting with my team, I’d probably be pulling my hair. :p.
It’s always so nice to hear from you, and I’m really glad we can chat whenever we can. Thank you for being patient！
[12/25/24, 01:49:26] ChloeH: image omitted
[12/27/24, 06:37:26] ChloeH: I just finished reading Herland! It was such an interesting read. Among the three male characters, I really appreciate that Charlotte chose Van as the main perspective to tell the story. His neutral, observational nature feels the least uncomfortable of the three. Van presents facts without much emotional bias and this personality really align with mine.  If his observations had been more comprehensive it would’ve been even better.
While Jeff has a positive attitude toward women, tends to romanticize and idealize them—placing them on a moral high ground as if they’re inherently superior. I kinda feel that regardless of gender, this kind of pedestal, though positive, is still a restriction. It’s like a gilded cage, locking women into unrealistic expectations of perfection. I’ve noticed this because I also used to have a favorable impression of women and sometimes place similar expectations on them. The downside is that when I meet someone who falls far outside those expectations, it can lead to disappointment. But I’ve learned to understand and respect the complexity and individuality of different women. Pre-setting these expectations, even if they’re positive, is still a form of stereotyping.
And Terry. 😑👎I was rolling my eyes on him whenever he talked. He’s like one of those typical finance bro with toxic masculinity. I couldn’t even understand why anyone in this women’s utopia would be attracted to him. His toxic traits are just so overbearing. If the book had expanded on his partner’s perspective, it would’ve been fascinating. I just really curious about what drew her to someone who constantly offended women.
[12/27/24, 06:38:05] ChloeH: It also made me think about why Charlotte created such a character in the first place.
There’s a psychological theory that suggests the people you despise often reflect something about yourself or your lived experience. Given her unfortunate childhood and marriage，Terry feels like an exaggerated embodiment of her contempt for patriarchal society. His behavior and attitudes amplify how men of her time demeaned, constrained, and controlled women.
What really made me laugh were Terry comments about how “women like to be mastered” or how they supposedly lack that “natural yielding.” These ridiculous and inaccurate reflections on women are still so frequent today.
[12/27/24, 06:38:31] ChloeH: Charlotte’s intent to liberate women as individuals is clear, but this book leans more toward collectivism than individualism. While it mentions encouraging each woman to pursue her own interests, it often feels like individual uniqueness is drowned out by the collective. In the latter part of the book, there are brief references to differences among the three women paired with the male protagonists, but I wish these differences had been explored more deeply. Sometimes those women in this book feel like the same person repeated, especially compared to the distinctly drawn male leads.
And about motherhood—it’s emphasized so heavily throughout the book that it made me wonder Is this focus itself a limitation? While Herland celebrates motherhood as central to society, it still ties women’s value to nurturing roles. But women aren’t inherently bound to motherhood. Personally I would think Individualism and personal ambition are just as valid to women.
[12/27/24, 06:38:50] ChloeH: Speaking of competition, my friend and I had a discussion about this while reading the book. Before this book I’d been reading The Art of War, and one comment stuck with me: ”War is inevitable.” It made me wonder are men’s pursuits of brutality, violence, and bloodshed what make it inevitable? My friend argued that competition exists in a female world too. Whenever resources are scarce, conflict will arise. I agree competition is inevitable, but I think women would approach it in a gentler way.
I wasn’t very sure so I looked into this. It’s glad to know that history is full of examples of brilliant female leaders who used collaborative, win-win strategies to resolve resource conflicts. Beyond famous global figures, I’ve seen this in my managers as well. They sit down, talk things through, and solve problems together and no backstabbing necessary.
I’ve also wondered whether gentler reform methods might slow social progress. But it turns out they don’t lack momentum—they just progress in a more sustainable way.
[12/27/24, 06:39:12] ChloeH: The relationships in this book are very beautiful and moving. I also loved the emphasis on lifelong learning and self-improvement, which is a theme that runs throughout the story. It reminded me of an interview I once watched with Steve Jobs, where he talked about admiring people who are intelligent and focused on growth, rather than those who get stuck in their egos or caught up defending their pride. This idea of continuous growth felt especially inspiring. Thank you for recommending it!
[12/27/24, 06:39:59] ChloeH: Btw last time we passed by the 30 Rock Christmas tree, you asked if they use a new tree every year. I looked into it, and yes, they do—this year’s tree was planted by the Albert family back in 1967 in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and they just cut it down. Honestly, it doesn’t feel like the right thing to do and I feel a bit ashamed for never thought about it before. I was just admiring how beautiful it looks.
Although the tree’s life was taken，it’s boosting tourism and supporting local businesses，which helps ensure that some families won’t be left without a home. And it also bring joy to visitors. I hope this makes the tradition feel a little more valuable , even if it’s not perfect. :( thank you providing such meaningful insight!

Wishing you a magical start to 2025,
Départ dans l'affection et le bruit neufs !
Chloe
[12/31/24, 21:15:43] Tamara: Hi Chloe ! 
Many, many thanks for your lovely messages and wishes which I reciprocate - I hope 2025 will see many your dreams come true and I’m sure great things are awaiting you! 
It was a pleasure meeting you this year! 
And thank you for this saying I did not know! What is it customary to wish in Chinese (the new year is not yet there but…)? 
Happy new year! 🎊
[12/31/24, 21:16:30] Tamara: I’ll reply to your other messages later when I’m a bit rested
[12/31/24, 21:16:35] Tamara: Enjoy your night !
[12/31/24, 21:22:12] ChloeH: No worries！Have fun and enjoy the new year！
[12/31/24, 21:29:23] ChloeH: image omitted
[1/2/25, 01:59:08] Tamara: So here I am. First things first, are you feeling better? It’s pretty common to get sick around the end of the year. Hope you were able to rest and take some time off!
[1/2/25, 02:01:18] Tamara: Translations are sometimes rushed and don’t pay attention to the nuances of the original version. It indeed seems like the Mandarin translation does not reflect what the book is about: women. We do have a similar rule in French: whenever you refer to a group of persons including at least one man, you will use the male plural form (ils). That’s even if you have 30000 women with him….
[1/2/25, 02:03:08] Tamara: Yes, I really like the front page of this version! Mine was quite different (as I read it in French after finding about it in a Swiss bookshop)
[1/2/25, 02:04:06] Tamara: It’s great that you have a week off; have you made some plans? I hope you were able to rest a bit and enjoy the festivities - New Year must be magic in NYC
[1/2/25, 02:08:00] Tamara: I’m very glad you enjoyed this book - it’s truly amazing when you think that it was written more than 100 years ago. The author was truly ahead of her time! 
The three characters are pretty well-chosen and balance each others as well. Van’s observations are neutral, but yet made from the male gaze at the time. The simple fact that these three are pretty adamant on the fact of finding this secret land is, in itself, a truly male endeavor
[1/2/25, 02:12:09] Tamara: Perhaps this character is supposed to reflect what was the general view of men on women and to create a continuum of manhood with the women’s adorer and someone in the middle (Van).
It may be that Terry is the embodiment of her personal experience with men and patriarcal society. In any case, the contrasts between the three of them are interesting on how a man may react to women empowerment. Terry would be today’s INCEL that feels left behind and rightful in his mistreatment of woman (an Andrew Tate), Van the adaptable man and Jeff the cause’s ally
[1/2/25, 02:18:00] Tamara: You’re right to emphasis the collectivist aspect of the book and I think the main idea was to portray a society that is exclusively female as not only being able to function, but to thrive. Perhaps the critique is more geared toward the treatment as a whole, as a social group, rather than on an individual basis. The emphasis on the woman as an individual is a topic that appeared later in the feminist literature (A Room of One’s Own by V. Woolf is great btw). 
Feminist resistance started, in the United States, with demands for equal voting and civic rights. Demands were collective in nature.
Don’t you think that the fact that the book shows how truly great a society women can create also celebrates the capacity of individual women? Many women are portrayed in roles that are typically men at that time
[1/2/25, 02:22:21] Tamara: Whether violence is a male attribute only is such a fascinating topic. There’s a lot of research that has been done about women’s involvement in the Holocaust and while no German woman was present at the Nuremberg Trial where only main perpetrators were being dealt with, some were tried in court for their complicity. Many said that they had been socialized by men to be violent and therefore they were innocent. Dig further and you will see that some actually found pleasure in torturing and witnessing acts of torture and violence.
[1/2/25, 02:23:09] Tamara: Tis is so so cool! Way better than any other Xmas tree and carbon-free!! Thanks for sharing!
[1/2/25, 02:24:20] Tamara: I love it! And your writing is not bad at all! When would you use the third saying and not the second or vice-versa? Is one more appropriate than the other in certain situations?

[1/2/25, 02:25:07] Tamara: A few snapshots of the past few days
[1/3/25, 06:43:17] ChloeH: Hey Tamara！Good afternoon，thank you for asking！I got full recovery last week and had a great holiday with my friends.
[1/3/25, 08:05:13] ChloeH: During the holidays my friends and I decided to try something fun—do whatever comes to mind at that moment. It all started when we planned to go skiing in Vermont. We rented a car but totally forgot to book a place to stay and two of my friend even completely forgot we had plans. At the very last minute we switched plans and decided to go to Catamount instead. The night before, we rushed to buy all the ski gear and somehow managed to get tickets. 
After a few triumphant laps on the bunny hill (where I obviously mastered the art of looking like I know what I’m doing), I very confidently decided it was time for the green trail. Spoiler: I wasn’t. I ended up falling about a dozen times, and most of my energy went into figuring out how to stand back up—apparently, that’s the real workout. But it was so much fun that I’m already thinking of going skiing again next month
This one spontaneous decision turned out so fun and exciting that we decided to embrace this impulsive spirit for the whole holiday. We ended up doing so many things completely on a whim—it was such a refreshing and thrilling way to spend the break! 
I cook New Year’s Eve dinner for my friend and I decided to learn how to make Tiramisu one day before the dinner and successfully made it. The final menu was determined on my way to grocery shopping. We just randomly brainstormed what we wanted to eat.
Yesterday afternoon we were watching the movie Chicago, and halfway through, we decided why not go see it live on Broadway? So we booked tickets last-minute and ended up with front-row seats! The performance was absolutely stunning—the dancing and singing were so powerful, moving, and beautiful！！！At the end, when Roxie was throwing roses, she looked right in our direction, but we weren’t able  to catch that one. 
It’s been so much fun. No overthinking, no meticulous planning—just going with the flow and seeing where it takes you. It feels freeing, exciting, and a little chaotic for sure. 
Have you ever done anything like that?
[1/3/25, 08:17:22] ChloeH: Thank you so much for sharing those photos！they’re really beautiful! When you mentioned snow in Switzerland a few days ago, I actually wanted to ask if you could take some photos, but I didn’t want to bother you. Appreciate it！
How was your holiday? Did you do anything fun or exciting with your family？Or maybe read any interesting book?
[1/3/25, 12:06:16] ChloeH: How’s the cover of your book look like？There are several versions of front page on Amazon and I feel this one mostly align with the theme of Herland, full of color，vitality and seriousness.
[1/3/25, 16:16:23] ChloeH: That’s indeed very annoying and we see this issue across different languages. I noted that there is a gender-neutral pronoun in French （iel），is this widely used？Just curious whether gender-neutral language becoming more common in French and German these years. This book was translated into Chinese in 2015 and we have only started to use TA （they）in casual writing as a gender-neutral option since 2020. It’s not official but I do hope it’s a step toward inclusivity.  Btw I do have a stupid question，could international law push for more  gender-neutral language in places where gendered forms dominate？

[1/5/25, 00:08:54] ChloeH: Sharing some photos of New Year in NYC. ：）New Year’s vibe in New York was incredibly lively （also extremely crowded）I spent most of the time hanging out with my friend so took extra 2 days off to have do some reading and cooking.
[1/5/25, 02:15:04] ChloeH: That’s a fascinating observation! Their （the three male characters）relentless pursuit of discovering this secret land does feel very much like a traditionally male narrative of conquest and exploration. It’s interesting when compare their behavior with the society they find in Herland. The women in the book don’t pursue or conquer in the same way—they build, nurture, and sustain. I really like how those women’s enthusiasm in learning and growing. Life to them was growth; their pleasure was in growing, and their duty also. They grew together-not by competition, but by united action. <This message was edited>
[1/5/25, 02:21:41] ChloeH: You made a great point！Herland truly does portray a thriving, exclusively female society as a collective whole, and your insights have given me a fresh perspective on how to interpret that. 
I used to see the lack of emphasis on individual women in Herland as a limitation, but now you’ve mentioned it I can see how it aligns with the priorities of its time—a response to systemic inequality through collective solidarity and I can see how the collective achievements are rooted in women’s individual strength and competence.
Thank you for sharing such thoughtful ideas. I’m also looking forward to exploring V. Woolf’s works now.
[1/6/25, 03:37:12] ChloeH: Thank you! I’m glad you liked it. To answer your question, the third one, 万事如意 (May everything go your way), is a bit more formal and broad, so it’s often used in written greetings or with people you want to show respect to, like elders or colleagues. The second one, 心想事成 (May all your wishes come true), feels more personal and is commonly used with friends and family to wish them success with their specific goals. 新年快乐 is the most universal and safe to use with anyone—it’s straightforward and fits all contexts. 
Also thank you for saying that！Compared to my mom, mine definitely doesn’t measure up. When I mentioned my handwriting was bad and you asked if I’d ever practiced, it made me realize some things I’m not good at aren’t about talent—they’re about effort. Since then I’ve started writing something every day, and it’s been satisfying to see small improvements. It’s also about using little psychology trick to keep myself motivated—reminding myself that if I think I’m bad at something, I can always stay desired to improve with consistent effort.
Speaking of psychology, there’s a concept called “wise interventions” from social psychology that focuses on improving certain aspects of life by making small but meaningful adjustments to our mindset and actions. I’ve found this surprisingly effective. Last time you mentioned how pursuing a PhD can feel overwhelming sometimes due to the long journey ahead, and I can really relate. Adjusting mindset and celebrating small wins helps a lot when I faced similar issues. Even tiny steps, like reading for just three minutes, add up over time and contribute to progress. When we achieve small wins, our brain releases dopamine—the “feel-good” chemical. This reinforces positive behavior and creates a reward loop, which can make us more likely to keep going. It’s almost like training our mind to associate effort with satisfaction, even if the ultimate goal feels far away. Hope this perspective is helpful. 
Also, I’m very sorry my responses can be a bit on and off sometimes. I had limited time to check my phone over the past few days but I don’t like replying in a hurry, so I wait for longer time windows to read your messages and respond thoughtfully. Take care！
[1/7/25, 11:15:41] Tamara: You could make a novel out of it. I could imagine it being titled “vivre dans l’instant présent” (to give a pedantic French touch ;))
Joke apart, I’m very glad you enjoyed your first ski experience despite a few bumps. I’ve been skiing since I’m five and it’s more often than I would like to admit it that I end on my butt. But as you said, it’s part of the experience! 
It also seems like you had a very exciting winter break! It’s very nice not to always plan out things and go with the wind.
To be honest, most of my activities are planned in advance unfortunately. I’m a bit of a control freak and the simple idea of not knowing where I’m going to sleep scares me. Also, I’ve always lived far away from my close friends I could imagine doing such things with - when meeting someone takes you a 1.5h commute, planing ahead is almost mandatory
[1/7/25, 11:18:19] Tamara: Oh, please ask! I’m happy to share some pictures! Unfortunately, the snow is gone now and it’s been raining quite a lot. Hopefully, it will be back this weekend.
My holidays have been great, thanks! I’ve forced myself to take some time off and spent a lot of time going on walks in the mountains with my parents and friends. The festivities also kept me occupied a great deal! I’ve been reading quite a lot as well; currently reading Dune
[1/7/25, 11:19:00] Tamara: image omitted
[1/7/25, 11:23:32] Tamara: These gendered languages drive me mad! The iel pronoun would would work but its use is still a niche thing. It’s not recognized by the French academy. It’s also difficult to use in sentences in which there’s an adjective. If you translate they’re good looking, you’d have “iels sont beaux.elles”. I’m glad efforts are being made in China about it. How are laws formulated? In a neutral way?
It’s a good question. If worded in a certain way, international legal norms (comprised in treaties and legal texts) could help spread the use of non-gendered formulations.
[1/7/25, 11:24:43] Tamara: They look great! I see that the lights are still on and the streets look festive! 
What have you been reading these days?
[1/7/25, 11:27:54] Tamara: One could read in the author’s choice of narrating perspective almost an equation of the male personality with broader patterns in male-dominated societies, incl. colonization etc. I wonder if she had a particular stance on that
[1/7/25, 11:34:20] Tamara: I just did a quick search about it and Perkins appears to be a contested figure, especially because of her writings during the segregation period. I’ll have to look into it a bit more
[1/7/25, 11:36:04] Tamara: On the basis of what I just read, one of Gilman’s main thread was the depiction of a female-dominated thriving society, depicting women’s equality if not superiority to men
[1/7/25, 11:36:38] Tamara: She’s basically depicting how great a female society could be
[1/7/25, 11:46:30] Tamara: Thank you for clarifying that! French knows a specific pronouns for formality (vous as you) and one for informality (tu as you). Can formality be expressed in the same way in Chinese? You said you don’t have pronouns, but there’s perhaps something 
Calligraphy is an art and it takes a lot of training. Not that it qualifies as such, but I remember spending countlness hours improving my writing in compulsory school. During high school, my best friend and me had a very similar handwriting. We perfected it so that we could proofread each other essays and hand over the other person’s paper without the teacher suspecting. 
Do you use brushes for your calligraphy? I find it mind blowing! 
Thank you for sharing this concept of wise interventions.  Little daily successes can really help in that regard and feel rewarding. I really to find such activities that I don’t use as an excuse for procrastinating. And the brain is such a fascinating muscle. In particular emotions!
[1/7/25, 11:46:50] Tamara: And please don’t apologize! I’m pretty bad at replying myself
[1/7/25, 11:46:55] Tamara: Take care as well!
[1/12/25, 17:40:24] ChloeH: Salut Tamara! Bonsoir en Suisse, et bon après-midi depuis mon fuseau horaire!
[1/12/25, 17:44:30] ChloeH: Hope your research is going well and that you’re finding ways to enjoy every moment, whether you’re working or not! How’s your week been so far?
I’m so happy to hear you took some time off and enjoyed some reading! Resting is so important, and it’ll definitely help boost productivity when back to work. Walking in the mountains sounds so relaxing and peaceful—it’s something we don’t get much of here in New York City. Which mountain did you visit? Hopefully the snow has returned! Would you mind to share how festivals look like in Switzerland if you have any pictures？
How are you liking Dune so far? I read the series after watching the movie. At first, the sci-fi elements didn’t stand out much since the movie felt more focused on the religious and mystical aspects rather than technology. My favorite movie used to be Interstellar, partly because of its hard sci-fi theories, but I also loved how it ultimately attributed its miracle to love. When I read Dune, I realized how advanced technology feels so natural and ordinary in their world. The books had so many extra details that made everything click. Btw the TV series about Bene Gesserit’s world Dune Prophecy is in HBO recently.

[1/13/25, 04:33:20] ChloeH: You’re absolutely right! The brain is such a fascinating and complex part of us. Emotions, though—they’re on a whole other level of mystery. They defy logic and reason, and maybe that’s part of their beauty. They’re not meant to be fully explained by science but to be felt and understood on a personal level.
Even when we know which part of the brain controls emotions and how feelings work biologically or neuropsychologically, it still feels like rationalizing them never quite captures their depth. People who naturally connect with emotions and empathize so effortlessly always amaze and inspire me.
[1/15/25, 00:31:18] ChloeH: Completely agree! Many gendered language is so deeply rooted in bias and frustratingly unfair. It’s great to see progress in French, even with its challenges. Thanks for explaining how it works btw！
In China, promoting gender-neutral language hasn’t really come from legislation. Very unfortunately, laws still tend to reflect the male-dominated political system, though there’s slow progress. Yijiao and I have had many discussions about how frustrating this is. She understands this far better than I do and has a very impressive way of thinking logically through these issues. 
The shift toward gender-neutral terms has driven more by feminist movements over the past decade, amplified by social media. One incident that gained attention involved a prominent female author who repeatedly expressed that using male-specific terms for women is disrespectful. Despite her objections, she was still officially addressed with a male honorific, sparking widespread discussions. This eventually encouraged more people to avoid male-centered language and promote inclusivity. Recently, there’s even been a push to emphasize 她 （she）over 他 （he）to flip the focus. it’s hard to say which approach will have a bigger impact
It’s exciting to think about how international law could support these changes globally. We both strongly agree that having women involved in shaping legal systems or taking on leadership roles is so important. Iceland is such an inspiring example. It’s amazing to see what a female-led government can achieve.
[1/16/25, 03:13:26] ChloeH: Thanks! The holiday lights were really pretty, but most of them have come down now. I did find a few Christmas decorations last week, which was nice. Is there any festival decorations still there in Switzerland？
A few of books I have been reading. 1. Diesseits: Erzählungen by Hermann Hesse. His writing is so beautiful and calming！It feels like stepping into the world he was seeing and taking a break from noisy New York. Have you read anything by Hesse before?
2.Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang, which the movie Arrival was based on-how it explores language shaping how we view the world, plus it plays around with time and causality in a really mind-bending way.
3.Coaching Communication by Aifen Chen. Reading Herland reminds me a manager who draws out people’s potential and makes them feel truly respected. She’s like a real-world version of those ideas demonstrating in Herland-guiding people gently instead of using force, creating supportive environments to inspire us discover our own capabilities. It changed my mindset that I used to focus on being super efficient to avoid bugging anyone. This book is really guiding me through how to be more empathetic and understanding in human interactions.
[1/16/25, 03:14:07] ChloeH: It’s fascinating that Gilman’s idea of a thriving, female-dominated society is actually supported by plenty of data and real-world examples nowadays. I admire how forward-thinking she was, especially considering the era she lived. I’ve found that female-led environments place more emphasis on collaboration, emotional safety, and understanding. Many male managers just push their own preferred methods or say “Just do it,” whereas female leaders tend to listen, clarify their goals and expectations, and offer encouragement throughout. It just feels so right not to be around any males. :p
Given her own experiences and background, it’s no surprise that Gilman’s perspective is both complex and insightful. Another book of hers, The Yellow Wallpaper, is also interesting for how it addresses women’s mental health and societal roles.
[1/16/25, 03:16:06] ChloeH: It sounds so elegant to a non-French speaker. Thank you for showing how to say that in French！
Skiing must feel so natural for you after starting at such a young age. Even if you end up on your butt sometimes, I’m sure you do it with far more grace than we ever could. Was there a moment that made you fall in love with skiing
It must be tough living far from your close friends！！！planning ahead definitely sounds necessary in that situation. And TBH having a plan is often better than not making or following one at all. It’s such human nature to want stability and control and I can totally relate. Used to micromanage everything in life and wouldn’t start something unless I knew exactly where it was going. Things did got a little frustrated when it didn’t go as expected. Embrace unpredictability has been a key growth area for me these days. It’s good to realize how adaptable we can be when we let go of needing to control everything sometimes. 
Just putting this idea out there—if you’re ever in a good mood and not too busy and want to experience the “"vivre dans l'instant présent"，we could do the experiment in the NYC during the daytime, it’s the perfect place for spontaneous plans and you definitely won’t need to worry about not knowing where to sleep. It’s weird that wherever you go in NYC took you around 1 hour to do so. 
Skiing really helped a lot with this. The speed was too fast, and I had no idea where I was heading. It’s even felt like a therapy when I even build trust with the trainer as someone who has trust issue. 
Also don’t worry about procrastinating. It’s not procrastination—it’s just waiting for us to grow a little more mature and for the timing to be absolutely perfect! Plus, leaving it to the last moment is a great way to test our stress management and problem-solving skills. ;)

[1/18/25, 23:44:09] ChloeH: Hi Tamara！Not sure which day your flight is, but just wanted to let you know there’s a winter storm warning for tomorrow. Travel could be very difficult. If you’re traveling back soon, please stay safe and take care!
[1/21/25, 03:52:17] Tamara: Hi Chloe, hope you’re alright despite the snow storm and cold weather! I heard it’s terrible!
I’m very sorry for my silence - I’ve had some health issues in early January that recently got worse so my head has been elsewhere these days… Past week has been quite hectic because of that…
The peacefulness of nature is truly something I missed while in New York. Central Park is nice, but there’s always some human-made sound. I was mostly in neighboring places, such as Gstaad, Chamonix, les Pâquots, Morgins, etc.. These places are pretty low (between 1100 and 1400) so snow is gettin rarer these days. It was great to see some!
Have you heard of Carnival? It’s a Christian festive event very popular in Europe and America. You can see colorful parades and street parties. We celebrate it in some Swiss cantons (not mine), but here is a picture (not mine) of how people traditionally dress in Switzerland.
[1/21/25, 03:52:27] Tamara: image omitted
[1/21/25, 03:57:03] Tamara: I really enjoy reading Dune, though I took a break to read two books in between: Dalla parte di lei by Alba de Céspedes and Everyone knows your mother is a witch by Rivka Galchen. Both are very entertaining and well written. I think the first in particular could be of interest to you as it is a psychological exploration of women’s attitudes towards love and marriage during the inter-war period in Italy. It’s intense but I loved it
[1/21/25, 04:00:05] Tamara: I watched the first movie prior to reading the book and found it mildly interesting. I’m not a big sci-fi fan and the movie did not cover much of the plot of the first book. The book, however, addresses very interesting topics, such as exploitation of natural resources, imperialism, relations between indigenous populations and new comers. I’ll let you know when I finish it!
[1/21/25, 04:03:42] Tamara: Thanks a lot for the picture - it’s lovely although the morning color reminds of the sadness of winter. 
How is it it going with the Master’s degree? And is it still so intense with work? As you put it, at least they pay for your studies… 
I hope you have time to take care of you and listen to your body (trust me on that…)
[1/21/25, 04:10:09] Tamara: Thank you for explaining! I guess many languages share the same logic when it comes to express respect through words (with the slight exception of English, but perhaps medieval English knew such pronouns?). 
Nope, ‘vous’ is not used in the same manner, ie. to be overly polite or ironic. It’s pretty normal to address anyone you don’t know in a formal context in that way. 
It was very fun and no one never noticed. It’s now a fun fact we tell our friends. It would be impossible now given how our own writings have evolved, or mine. I write like a pig now :((
It sounds like a true form of art and it is. I like your mom’s saying. She sounds a like a very wise person! Did she teach you some? The samples of your work and hers are very esthetic!!
[1/21/25, 04:11:51] Tamara: I can get that, the question of false sense of accomplishment. On the other hand, however, if you don’t have appropriate material for any given activity, it might be discouraging because you can never achieve the result you want, irrespective of your talent. It’s a delicate balance
[1/21/25, 04:12:12] Tamara: This looks so professional and expensive !
[1/21/25, 08:20:03] ChloeH: Hi Tamara. I’m really really sorry to hear that you’re going through this. 🥹the most important thing is please focusing on resting right now. Are you feeling better today？Please get rest as much as you could and don’t worry about anything else.
[1/21/25, 08:22:21] ChloeH: It must has been tough. Hope you have the only the best of care and wishing for a quick recovery. Let me know if there’s anything I could help and Plz don’t apologizes. 🙁
[1/21/25, 16:58:54] Tamara: Hi Chloe! Thank you so much for your kind messages - it’s very thoughtful and I really do appreciate it! 
I’m getting as much rest as possible and got some medical attention, so that’s good! And reading lots and lots helps as well - thanks a lot!! 
We both need to learn how to stop apologizing I see ;)
[1/21/25, 16:59:56] Tamara: Take care of yourself as well! Hope you have the occasion to have some time for yourself today!
[1/21/25, 17:15:20] ChloeH: Glad to hear you are taking some time to rest！！Reading is such a great therapy activity! Really really happy for you. Just make sure to give eyes a break as well, it might make headache worse.
[1/21/25, 17:18:30] ChloeH: True，unlearning the habit of apologizing is harder than work. 🤣
[1/21/25, 17:21:42] ChloeH: Thank you, I’ll try! But honestly during weekdays my only ‘time for myself’ might be those time when I’m hiding in the restroom.
[1/21/25, 17:21:48] ChloeH: Have a great night！
[1/22/25, 16:36:38] Tamara: Thanks a lot! And you’re absolutely right! Reading is a beautiful therapy - it requires you to be active and brings you to beautiful places! But the downside is that it tires the eyes! 👀
[1/22/25, 16:37:30] Tamara: And unfortunately it’s a truly female habit - I don’t see many men apologizing (even when they should). That drives me crazy, along interrupting others!
[1/22/25, 16:38:49] Tamara: I’m sorry - I cannot imagine how demanding your schedule must be. I hope they at least respect your hours of sleep…
[1/22/25, 16:39:09] Tamara: And I also hope their toilets are nice and clean enough…
[1/22/25, 16:39:22] ChloeH: Hey Tamara！are you feeling better today？
[1/22/25, 16:41:03] ChloeH: We do have nice restrooms smells good. There are some well-being rooms in the office but it’s always locked. Guess those are only for boss
[1/22/25, 16:41:56] Tamara: Oh thank you for asking! It’s hard to say - my biggest issue is that I can barely sleep and it has taken a toll on me. So I’m resting, but it’s still a slow process
[1/22/25, 16:42:34] Tamara: What a band of rats! You should change the lockers!! And keep the Keyes for yourself
[1/22/25, 16:43:09] Tamara: I’m going to go try and try to sleep! Have a great day/night!
[1/22/25, 16:43:42] ChloeH: I’m so sorry to hear that. Have you tried Melatonin？it might help
[1/22/25, 16:44:22] ChloeH: Hope you have a sweet dream and sleep tight！
[1/22/25, 16:45:16] ChloeH: Steam Eye Mask also could help with relaxing eyes and sleeping.
[1/24/25, 01:50:04] ChloeH: Hey Tamara！Good morning. Just checking in to see how are you feeling today. I sincerely hope you had some good sleep and feeling a lot better or even fully recovered!
[1/24/25, 01:50:36] ChloeH: Have been thinking about your sleep struggles and wanted to share a few things that helped me when I went through something similar. You might have already tried some of these, but just in case:
1. Warm Foot Bath Improves blood circulation and relaxes the body, signaling the brain to prepare for sleep
2. Gently massaging the temples, neck, and shoulders can reduce tension, lower cortisol levels, and promote relaxation
3. Warm Herbal Teas like chamomile or those containing ashwagandha have calming effects on the nervous system and support better sleep
4.Dark, Quiet Environment is more sleep-friendly atmosphere to enhance sleep quality.
5.While alcohol may initially cause drowsiness, it disrupts sleep patterns and prevents restful sleep (as my psychiatrist explained 1000 times to me)
[1/24/25, 01:52:52] ChloeH: Recently read a study discussing how reading is highly effective for relaxation. Engaging in relaxing cognitive activities like reading can reduce stress, shift focus from worries, and calm the mind.

[1/24/25, 02:05:40] ChloeH: Today finally logged off and my manager promised me I can have a early end tomorrow （or it’s today, technically it’s already Friday）. I’m so sorry I didn’t got a chance to read through your previous messages but should be able to read them tomorrow. Bonne nuit and Bon rétablissement！
[1/24/25, 16:21:34] Tamara: Good afternoon Chloe, thank you so much for checking in and sharing some of your tips for better sleep! Hope you’re now able to have full nights of sleep 😴
[1/24/25, 16:23:16] Tamara: I’m also very happy you managed to get some time off today and get out of the office earlier - finally a decent schedule ;)
[1/24/25, 16:24:06] Tamara: I’ve had some insomnia episodes before, but never like this one
[1/24/25, 16:24:50] ChloeH: Thanks！Hope you had some good sleep
[1/24/25, 16:25:38] Tamara: I’m really a bit the shadow of myself these days and I’m hectic in my answers! I’m very sorry!
[1/24/25, 16:26:44] ChloeH: Please please don’t apologize and don’t feel pressure on responding. I deeply appreciate your message but I would be more happy if you feeling better
[1/24/25, 16:27:31] ChloeH: Feel so bad I couldn’t do anything to help.
[1/24/25, 16:30:10] ChloeH: Are you able to fall sleep during daytime？Asked my doctor once and he told me napping during daytime could impact night sleeping routine.

[1/25/25, 05:21:22] ChloeH: Thanks a lot！Although my schedule still very packed，I was completely not working at all at Friday. 🌝 We work from home on Friday （supposedly）but I just grabbed a book and work phone, sitting in a cafe and occasionally checked emails lol. Thursday we worked until 2AM and it was just too much. I was able to read through Moi les hommes, je les déteste by Pauline Harmange. Had a lot of fun reading it!
[1/25/25, 05:29:32] ChloeH: Btw Yijiao and I was discussing her presentation and she told me you could attend other people’s present online and re-schedule yours if you’re not feeling well. I really hope you feel better before then, but it’s good to know there’s some flexibility. Hope it goes well!
[1/26/25, 12:19:24] ChloeH: 🥺Salut Tamara，are you feeling a little bit better？Hope you are able to have some good sleep and reading books that bring you joy and energy.
