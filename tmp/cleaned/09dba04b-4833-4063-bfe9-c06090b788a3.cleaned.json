Sometimes the context surrounding a book—like the author’s perspective and personal life, the historical era, the audience’s reaction, or even how it’s translated into another language—can be just as fascinating as the book itself. It usually makes my reading experience more multidimensional and helps me understand the work better.I caught a terrible cold last Saturday so I didn’t make much progress over the weekend beyond coughing and sleeping :( . But I was really happy to receive the paperbacks of Herland and Scum Manifesto! :) I had to replace Scum Manifesto because the cover was damaged, so I’ve started reading Herland first.Before the paperback arrived, I was reading the Chinese translation of it. In Mandarin, we have different forms of ‘they’ depending on gender—‘他们’ for males and ‘她们’ for females. What really bothered me was that the translator used the male form ‘他们’ even when referring to an entirely female group. It’s such an ironic choice in a book like this, as it reinforces the idea of women being treated as the secondary gender.",

Among the three male characters, I really appreciate that Charlotte chose Van as the main perspective to tell the story. His neutral, observational nature feels the least uncomfortable of the three. Van presents facts without much emotional bias and this personality really align with mine. If his observations had been more comprehensive it would’ve been even better.While Jeff has a positive attitude toward women, tends to romanticize and idealize them—placing them on a moral high ground as if they’re inherently superior. I kinda feel that regardless of gender, this kind of pedestal, though positive, is still a restriction. It’s like a gilded cage, locking women into unrealistic expectations of perfection. I’ve noticed this because I also used to have a favorable impression of women and sometimes place similar expectations on them. The downside is that when I meet someone who falls far outside those expectations, it can lead to disappointment. But I’ve learned to understand and respect the complexity and individuality of different women. Pre-setting these expectations, even if they’re positive, is still a form of stereotyping.And Terry. 😑👎I was rolling my eyes on him whenever he talked. He’s like one of those typical finance bro with toxic masculinity. I couldn’t even understand why anyone in this women’s utopia would be attracted to him. His toxic traits are just so overbearing. If the book had expanded on his partner’s perspective, it would’ve been fascinating. I just really curious about what drew her to someone who constantly offended women.",

Given her unfortunate childhood and marriage，Terry feels like an exaggerated embodiment of her contempt for patriarchal society. His behavior and attitudes amplify how men of her time demeaned, constrained, and controlled women.What really made me laugh were Terry comments about how “women like to be mastered” or how they supposedly lack that “natural yielding.” These ridiculous and inaccurate reflections on women are still so frequent today.",

While it mentions encouraging each woman to pursue her own interests, it often feels like individual uniqueness is drowned out by the collective. In the latter part of the book, there are brief references to differences among the three women paired with the male protagonists, but I wish these differences had been explored more deeply. Sometimes those women in this book feel like the same person repeated, especially compared to the distinctly drawn male leads.And about motherhood—it’s emphasized so heavily throughout the book that it made me wonder Is this focus itself a limitation? While Herland celebrates motherhood as central to society, it still ties women’s value to nurturing roles. But women aren’t inherently bound to motherhood. Personally I would think Individualism and personal ambition are just as valid to women.",

Before this book I’d been reading The Art of War, and one comment stuck with me: ”War is inevitable.” It made me wonder are men’s pursuits of brutality, violence, and bloodshed what make it inevitable? My friend argued that competition exists in a female world too. Whenever resources are scarce, conflict will arise. I agree competition is inevitable, but I think women would approach it in a gentler way.I wasn’t very sure so I looked into this. It’s glad to know that history is full of examples of brilliant female leaders who used collaborative, win-win strategies to resolve resource conflicts. Beyond famous global figures, I’ve seen this in my managers as well. They sit down, talk things through, and solve problems together and no backstabbing necessary.I’ve also wondered whether gentler reform methods might slow social progress.

    "message": "You’re right to emphasis the collectivist aspect of the book and I think the main idea was to portray a society that is exclusively female as not only being able to function, but to thrive. Perhaps the critique is more geared toward the treatment as a whole, as a social group, rather than on an individual basis. The emphasis on the woman as an individual is a topic that appeared later in the feminist literature (A Room of One’s Own by V. Woolf is great btw). Feminist resistance started, in the United States, with demands for equal voting and civic rights. Demands were collective in nature.Don’t you think that the fact that the book shows how truly great a society women can create also celebrates the capacity of individual women? Many women are portrayed in roles that are typically men at that time",

Many said that they had been socialized by men to be violent and therefore they were innocent.

We rented a car but totally forgot to book a place to stay and two of my friend even completely forgot we had plans. At the very last minute we switched plans and decided to go to Catamount instead. The night before, we rushed to buy all the ski gear and somehow managed to get tickets. After a few triumphant laps on the bunny hill (where I obviously mastered the art of looking like I know what I’m doing), I very confidently decided it was time for the green trail. Spoiler: I wasn’t. I ended up falling about a dozen times, and most of my energy went into figuring out how to stand back up—apparently, that’s the real workout. But it was so much fun that I’m already thinking of going skiing again next monthThis one spontaneous decision turned out so fun and exciting that we decided to embrace this impulsive spirit for the whole holiday. We ended up doing so many things completely on a whim—it was such a refreshing and thrilling way to spend the break! I cook New Year’s Eve dinner for my friend and I decided to learn how to make Tiramisu one day before the dinner and successfully made it. The final menu was determined on my way to grocery shopping. We just randomly brainstormed what we wanted to eat.Yesterday afternoon we were watching the movie Chicago, and halfway through, we decided why not go see it live on Broadway? So we booked tickets last-minute and ended up with front-row seats! The performance was absolutely stunning—the dancing and singing were so powerful, moving, and beautiful！！！At the end, when Roxie was throwing roses, she looked right in our direction, but we weren’t able to catch that one. It’s been so much fun. No overthinking, no meticulous planning—just going with the flow and seeing where it takes you. It feels freeing, exciting, and a little chaotic for sure.

To answer your question, the third one, 万事如意 (May everything go your way), is a bit more formal and broad, so it’s often used in written greetings or with people you want to show respect to, like elders or colleagues. The second one, 心想事成 (May all your wishes come true), feels more personal and is commonly used with friends and family to wish them success with their specific goals. 新年快乐 is the most universal and safe to use with anyone—it’s straightforward and fits all contexts. Also thank you for saying that！Compared to my mom, mine definitely doesn’t measure up. When I mentioned my handwriting was bad and you asked if I’d ever practiced, it made me realize some things I’m not good at aren’t about talent—they’re about effort. Since then I’ve started writing something every day, and it’s been satisfying to see small improvements. It’s also about using little psychology trick to keep myself motivated—reminding myself that if I think I’m bad at something, I can always stay desired to improve with consistent effort.Speaking of psychology, there’s a concept called “wise interventions” from social psychology that focuses on improving certain aspects of life by making small but meaningful adjustments to our mindset and actions. I’ve found this surprisingly effective. Last time you mentioned how pursuing a PhD can feel overwhelming sometimes due to the long journey ahead, and I can really relate. Adjusting mindset and celebrating small wins helps a lot when I faced similar issues. Even tiny steps, like reading for just three minutes, add up over time and contribute to progress. When we achieve small wins, our brain releases dopamine—the “feel-good” chemical. This reinforces positive behavior and creates a reward loop, which can make us more likely to keep going. It’s almost like training our mind to associate effort with satisfaction, even if the ultimate goal feels far away. Hope this perspective is helpful. Also, I’m very sorry my responses can be a bit on and off sometimes. I had limited time to check my phone over the past few days but I don’t like replying in a hurry, so I wait for longer time windows to read your messages and respond thoughtfully. Take care！",

Thanks for explaining how it works btw！In China, promoting gender-neutral language hasn’t really come from legislation. Very unfortunately, laws still tend to reflect the male-dominated political system, though there’s slow progress. Yijiao and I have had many discussions about how frustrating this is. She understands this far better than I do and has a very impressive way of thinking logically through these issues. The shift toward gender-neutral terms has driven more by feminist movements over the past decade, amplified by social media. One incident that gained attention involved a prominent female author who repeatedly expressed that using male-specific terms for women is disrespectful. Despite her objections, she was still officially addressed with a male honorific, sparking widespread discussions. This eventually encouraged more people to avoid male-centered language and promote inclusivity. Recently, there’s even been a push to emphasize 她 （she）over 他 （he）to flip the focus. it’s hard to say which approach will have a bigger impactIt’s exciting to think about how international law could support these changes globally. We both strongly agree that having women involved in shaping legal systems or taking on leadership roles is so important. Iceland is such an inspiring example.

Many male managers just push their own preferred methods or say “Just do it,” whereas female leaders tend to listen, clarify their goals and expectations, and offer encouragement throughout. It just feels so right not to be around any males. :pGiven her own experiences and background, it’s no surprise that Gilman’s perspective is both complex and insightful.

It’s weird that wherever you go in NYC took you around 1 hour to do so. Skiing really helped a lot with this. The speed was too fast, and I had no idea where I was heading. It’s even felt like a therapy when I even build trust with the trainer as someone who has trust issue. Also don’t worry about procrastinating.

Both are very entertaining and well written. I think the first in particular could be of interest to you as it is a psychological exploration of women’s attitudes towards love and marriage during the inter-war period in Italy. It’s intense but I loved it",

I guess many languages share the same logic when it comes to express respect through words (with the slight exception of English, but perhaps medieval English knew such pronouns?). Nope, ‘vous’ is not used in the same manner, ie. to be overly polite or ironic. It’s pretty normal to address anyone you don’t know in a formal context in that way. It was very fun and no one never noticed. It’s now a fun fact we tell our friends. It would be impossible now given how our own writings have evolved, or mine. I write like a pig now :((It sounds like a true form of art and it is. I like your mom’s saying. She sounds a like a very wise person! Did she teach you some?

Gently massaging the temples, neck, and shoulders can reduce tension, lower cortisol levels, and promote relaxation3. Warm Herbal Teas like chamomile or those containing ashwagandha have calming effects on the nervous system and support better sleep4.Dark, Quiet Environment is more sleep-friendly atmosphere to enhance sleep quality.5.While alcohol may initially cause drowsiness, it disrupts sleep patterns and prevents restful sleep (as my psychiatrist explained 1000 times to me)",
