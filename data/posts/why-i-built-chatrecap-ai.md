Hi, I'm Cheer.

I didn't plan to build a relationship tool.  
It started from a place of confusion, and a quiet need to make sense of things that had once hurt.

## üå± Where it all began

In some of my past relationships, I often found myself unsure of what was really going on.  
Sometimes we'd talk every day, and suddenly ‚Äî silence.  

Sometimes I'd reread a message ten times, wondering if I had said something wrong.  
Other times, everything seemed fine‚Ä¶ until one day it wasn't.

I asked friends, searched online, listened to podcasts.  
I kept hoping someone would tell me:  
> "Yes, he liked you."  
> "No, it wasn't your fault."  
> "Here's what you missed."

But no one could. Not really.

Eventually, I realized I wasn't just looking for answers.  
I was looking for clarity ‚Äî something solid to hold onto when emotions got messy.

## ü§ñ When AI entered the picture

When AI became more accessible, I had a thought I couldn't shake:

> What if I could use AI to understand my own relationship patterns ‚Äî through the way we actually talked?

Not as a diagnosis.  
Not as a gimmick.  
Just something calm and quiet to help me see things I hadn't been able to see before.

So I started building.

I didn't have a background in coding. I wasn't trying to launch a product.  
I just wanted to learn how to make something that felt emotionally useful.  
And I taught myself, step by step, late at night, one problem at a time.

## üß© What it became

**ChatRecap AI** reads your chat history and gives back a short, AI-generated reflection of what it sees ‚Äî tone, patterns, emotional signals.  
Not perfect.  
But sometimes, surprisingly honest.

And for me, that was enough to keep going.

## üêö Why I'm sharing this now

Because I think there are people out there who feel the same way I did.  
Not lost, but quietly wondering.  
Not heartbroken, but unsure how to name what they're feeling.  
Not looking for advice ‚Äî just looking for clarity.

This isn't a pitch.  
This isn't a polished product.  
It's just something I made, with care.

If this speaks to you ‚Äî if you've ever wished you could see a relationship more clearly, without judgment or panic ‚Äî I hope you'll try it.  
And if you have thoughts or ideas, I'd love to hear them.

I'm still building.  
And I'd like to build with people who feel things deeply too.
